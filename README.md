# ASL Recognition with Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for American Sign Language (ASL) recognition using deep learning techniques.

## Introduction
American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural language used by the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. ASL recognition systems can bridge the communication gap between individuals who use ASL and those who do not understand the language.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the ASL Alphabet dataset, which contains labeled images representing each letter of the ASL alphabet.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset.
2. Train the ASL recognition model.
3. Test the ASL recognition model.

## Results
The trained ASL recognition model achieves good accuracy on the ASL Alphabet dataset.
